# Project 4 - *Zwitter*

**Zwitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
 I never used Twitter before so it was hard to know how it works and what does it do so It took me really long time to figure how the app and its api actually works. I wish there were more explanation about the api and the twitter app in general and actually design to see so I could understand more clearly about the app.
